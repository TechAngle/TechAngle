# About me
I am a self-taught programmer who learns **Golang** and **JS/TS**.

I spend most of my free time *enhancing my skills in coding, staying current with some IT trends, and looking into new technologies*, since I am committed to constant self-improvement.
**My goal** - someday help to create a high-quality product which is going to be the most important for people.
