# About me

I am a self-taught programmer who specializes in **Python**. My programming interest is balanced by my artistic side, which I like exploring through art and immersing myself in the world of *EDM* music.

I spend most of my free time *enhancing my skills in coding, staying current with industry trends, and looking into new technologies* , since I am committed to constant self-improvement. I thrive on difficult projects and am dedicated to producing high-quality results.

## Goals for the future

My vision for the future is twofold:

1. **Advancing Technology:** I am committed to pushing the boundaries of what technology can achieve. I want to work on cutting-edge projects that not only solve complex problems but also shape the way we live and work in a world of digital technologies. My goal is to contribute to the development of innovative solutions that have a meaningful impact on society.

2. **Inspiring others:** Equally important to me is inspiring and motivating others. I want to be a source of motivation for individuals on their own journeys of improvement. Whether through mentoring, sharing knowledge or participating in tech communities, I aim to foster an environment where learning and growth are celebrated. I believe that by lifting each other up, we can collectively reach greater heights in the technology industry.

Essentially, my future goals revolve around being at the forefront of technological advancement and creating a positive ripple effect in the tech community.
